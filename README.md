# AppiumConf 2019 Demo Code

This is the code for my AppiumConf 2019 Keynote demo (link to talk video TBD), involving electronic automation of a drum machine built with an [Adafruit Circuit Playground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333) (CPX), using an experimental [Appium Raspberry Pi Driver](https://github.com/jlipps/appium-raspi-driver) driving a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).

Here's what the drum machine looks like!

This repo consists of two components:

1. Code for the CPX to support the drum machine app. Check it out [here](cpx). This is essentially the "app code".
2. Appium code used in conjunction with the Appium Raspberry Pi Driver. Check it out [here](raspi). This is essentially the "test code".
